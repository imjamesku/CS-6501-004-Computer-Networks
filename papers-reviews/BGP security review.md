###### tags: `class`

## Paper Title: 
BGP Security in Partial Deployment 
Is the Juice Worth the Squeeze? 

## Overall merit:
5. Excellent paper. I will champion for acceptance.

## Reviewer expertise:
1. No familiarity

## Novelty:
4. New contribution

## Paper summary:
In this paper, they study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S\*BGP, compared those already provided by origin authentication. They found that S\*BGP provides only meager benefits over origin authentication when popular policies like S\*BGP are used. They also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S\*BGP, and show how interactions between S\*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.

## Paper Strengths:
They focus on issues previous research ignored and recognized some unrealistic assumptions previous work made.

## Paper Weaknesses:
Nothing


## Comments for author:
I appreciate how the author questions the benefits of popular policies and proved that they may not be worth adopting.
