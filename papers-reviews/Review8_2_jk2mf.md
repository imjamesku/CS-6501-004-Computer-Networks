# QUIC Review
## Paper Title: The QUIC Transport Protocol: Design and Internet-Scale Deployment

## Overall merit:
5. Excellent paper. I will champion for acceptance.

## Reviewer expertise:
2. Some familiarity

## Novelty:
4. New contribution

## Paper summary:
In the paper, they present their experience with QUIC, a new transport designed from the ground up to improve performance for HTTPS traffic and to enable rapid deployment and continued evolution of transport mechanisms. They describe their motivations for developing QUIC, the principles that guided their design, how they perform interactive experiments on QUIC, performance improvements, and their experience deploying QUIC globally.

## Paper Strengths:
- Detailed description of the design
- Diversified experiments
- Presented results from real world deployments
- Open source code

## Paper Weaknesses:
May be hard and take a long time to popularize since it requires modifications to network devices

## Comments for author:
It's great to see how a protocol used in real world application was designed.
