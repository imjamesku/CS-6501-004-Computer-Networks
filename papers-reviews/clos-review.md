## Paper Title:Jupiter Rising: A Decade of Clos Topologies and 
Centralized Control in Googleâ€™s Datacenter Network

## Overall merit:
4. Good paper. I can accept this paper but will not champion it.

## Reviewer expertise:
1\. No familiarity

## Novelty:
3. Incremental improvement

## Paper summary:
Bandwidth demands in the datacenter are doubling every 12-15 months. Ten years ago, they found the cost and operational complexity associated with traditional datacenter network architectures to be prohibitive. They present our approach for overcoming the cost, operational complexity, and limited scale endemic to data center networks a decade ago. 

## Paper Strengths:
- actual deployment
- explanation with examples
- pictures that help visualization

## Paper Weaknesses:
Questionable practicality for most people/companies who are not Google.
