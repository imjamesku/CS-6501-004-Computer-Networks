# Understanding the Mirai Botnet  Review
## Paper Title: Understanding the Mirai Botnet 

## Overall merit:
4. Good paper. I can accept this paper but will not champion it.

## Reviewer expertise:
2. Some familiarity

## Novelty:
4. New contribution

## Paper summary:
In this paper, they analyze Mirai's emergence and evolution, the devices it targeted and infected, and the attacks it executed. They found that while IoT devices present many unique security challenges, Mirai's emergence was primarily based on the absence of best security practices in IoT, which resulted in a fragile environment susceptible to abuse.

## Paper Strengths:
- includes the entire timeline
- has charts showing the number of infected devices
- analyzes the device composition which I think provides good insights into what action to take

## Paper Weaknesses:
Does not present applicable solution to the problem

## Comments for author:
I appreciate their bringing attention to IoT security. Security is often neglected and the consequences may be fatal, as shown by Mirai.
